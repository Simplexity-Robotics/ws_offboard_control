to run the comp_routine you need to do the following commands:

colcon build (make sure you do this in the ws_offboard_control directory. it will build the comp routine package)
ros2 run comp_routine comp_routine

some other helpful commands:

ps -ax | grep "comp" (this can be used to check if the comp routine node is still running)
kill -9 [enter process number] (this can be used to force kill a node)
