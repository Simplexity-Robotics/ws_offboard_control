[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrosbag2_test_common.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rosbag2_test_common", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "rosbag2_test_common" with any of the following names:

    rosbag2_test_commonConfig.cmake
    rosbag2_test_common-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rosbag2_test_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "rosbag2_test_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "rosbag2_test_common" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
